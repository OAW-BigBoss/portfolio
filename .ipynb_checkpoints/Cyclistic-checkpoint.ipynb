I encounter several problems with R, some that appeared when I tried to daily drive it, I would called it the end of the honeymoon stage.\n",

At one point, I was able to see the all time high of usages on July 2021 but the majority of trips were performed by the casuals.\n",

    "**Trends:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a trend, or in other words a seasonality. It is notable that in Q3 occur the highest peaks of usage, Q1 presents the lowest points of usage. This is mostly due to the weather in each stage of the year, having the least rain in Q3 and the most rain in Q1. Q2 presents increases and Q4 decreases since the evolution of the weather on each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**relationships:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A weird relationship that was found within the data was that the casual riders performed longer trips with every type of bike than the members. This is an opportunity to transform casuals into members, have charge after X amount of miles traveled.\n",

    "The visualization that I'm the most proud of is the one called: Trips by Month. There is one variable that is always present in every dataset, this variable is called: time. The time on the events happen and how time factors affect the study are always important. It is a must to check any variable and their relationship with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would have liked to have the pricing data of the membership and what the membership entailed. Check wether the cost of the membership and its perks is worth the money to the costumers. Maybe it would be the best to create a new type of billing knowing that the casuals make longer rides than the members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other type of data that I would have liked is geographical data. With this is intended to find a pattern in the usage if the bikes, for example: If the city has apartments or suburbs in one area and the offices in an adjacent area. The idea would be to have a bigger amount of bikes next to where the people live, so they take the bike to work and delivered it closer to their jobs.  \n"
